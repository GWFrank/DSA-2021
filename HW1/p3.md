### 1.

#### Algorithm

**Workflow:**

1. Create an array `visited` with the same length as `A`, and set all values to `False`. It would keep track of if the position on `A` has been visited.
2. Set `cur` equal to the initial position.
3. Repeat the following things until return:
   1. If `cur` is the same as our next position (which is `A[cur]`), then return "will stop".
   2. If `visited[cur]` is `True`, it means we are in a loop, return "won't stop".
   3. Else, we set `visited[cur]` to `True`, and set `cur` to the next position.

**Written in pseudo code:**

```pseudocode
func judgeStop(A, start):
	A_len = A.len()
	visited[A_len] = {False}
	cur = start
	while(cur != A[cur]):
		if(visited[cur] = True):
			return False
		else:
			visited[cur] = True
			cur = A[cur]
	return True
```

We know that the frog will either stop at some point or go into a loop. When the frog will stop, the algorithm obviously works. When the frog will go in to a loop, since the array has a finite size, the loop also has a finite size, and that means the frog will visit a position twice. Therefore the algorithm will also work in this scenario.

#### Time Complexity & Extra-space Complexity

In the worst case, my algorithm will traverse the entire array `A` then stop, therefore the time complexity would be $O(n)$.

For extra-space complexity, the additional variables I used are `A_len`, `visited`, and `cur`, and they respectively take up $O(1)$, $O(n)$, and $O(1)$ spaces. Therefore the extra-space complexity in total is $O(n)$.

#### Algorithm

**Workflow:**

1. Create an array `visited` with the same length as `A`, and set all values to `0`. It would keep track of at which iteration is the position visited.
2. Set `cur` equal to the initial position. Set `cnt = 1`, which is the counter of iteration times.
3. Repeat the following things until return:
   1. If `visited[cur]` isn't `0`, it means we have completed a loop. Therefore we return `cur - visited[cur]`, which is the length of the loop.
   2. Else, we set `visited[cur]` to `cnt`, `cur` to the next position, and add `1` to `cnt`.

**Written in pseudo code:**

```pseudocode
func getLoopLen(A, start):
	A_len = A.len()
	visited[A_len] = {0}
	cur = start
	cnt = 1
	while(True):
		if(visited[cur] != 0):
			return cnt - visited[cur]
		else:
			visited[cur] = cnt
			cur = A[cur]
			cnt = cnt+1
```

#### Time Complexity & Extra-space Complexity

Because there is only one position we would visit twice, the worst time complexity possible would be $O(n)$ (when the loop is as large as the whole array).

For extra-space complexity, the additional variables I used are `A_len`, `visited`, `cur`, and `cnt`, and they respectively take up $O(1)$, $O(n)$, $O(1)$, and $O(1)$ spaces. Therefore the extra-space complexity in total is $O(n)$.

### 3.

#### Algorithm

**Math stuff:**

$A$ is a stricly increasing array

$\Rightarrow \forall\ m>n, a_m > a_n$

By median's property, we have:

$a_0 \le M_{0,i} \le a_{i-1},\ a_i \le M_{i,j} \le a_{j-1},\ a_j \le M_{j,n} \le a_{n-1} $

$\Rightarrow M_{0,i}<M_{i,j}<M_{j,n}$

$\Rightarrow f(i,j) = M_{j,n}-M_{0,i}$

To minimize $f(i,j)$, we need $j=i+1$ because:

$\forall\ j > i+1,\ a_{(j+n-1)/2} > a_{(i+1+n-1)/2}$

$\Rightarrow \forall\ j>i+1,\ M_{j,n} > M_{i+1,n}$

$\Rightarrow \forall\ j>i+1,\ f(i,j) > f(i,i+1)$

**Workflow:**

1. Initiallize `current_min`, `min_i`, and `min_j`
2. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-2`
3. In each interation, let `j=i+1`, calculate median of `A[j:n]` and `A[0:i]`, then substract them to get $f(i, j)$
4. Update `current_min`, `min_i`, and `min_j` if the current $f(i, j)$ is smaller
5. Return `min_i` and `min_j` when the loop ends

**Written in pseudo code:**

```pseudocode
minimizeF(A, n)
	current_min = INF
	min_i, min_j = -1, -1
	for i from 1 to n-2
		j = i+1
		f = median(A[j:n]) - median(A[0:i])
		if f < current_min
			current_min = f
			min_i = i
			min_j = j
	return min_i, min_j
```

#### Time Complexity & Extra-space Complexity

Getting the median of an array is only $O(1)$ because the index can be calculated given the start and end index. Plus my algorithm runs a single for loop, therefore the time complexity would be $O(n)$.

All extra variables have constant space despite n, therefore the extra-space complexity is $O(1)$.

### 4.

#### Algorithm

**Workflow:**

1. Traverse the circular linked list and find the two decreasing node, name them `h1` and `h2`.
2. Save a copy of `h1` and `h2` as `end2` and `end1`.
3. Set `new_head` point to the smaller one between `h1` and `h2`, and let the chosen node go to next node.
4. Set `cur_node=new_head`. Treat `h1` and `h2` as if they are two linked lists, merge them into `new_head`. Merging is to choose the smaller one between two nodes, link `cur_tail` to it, then let the chosen node go to next node.
5. When one of `h1` and `h2` has gone to the end, go to the end of the leftover linked list, update the tail's `next`, then connect the whole list to `cur_tail`.

**Written in pseudo code:**

```pseudocode
sortL(head)
	// get the two decreasing node
	h1, h2 = NIL, NIL
	cur_node = head
	while h2 == NIL
		if cur_node.value > cur_node.next.value
			if h1 == NIL
				h1 = cur_node
			else
				h2 = cur_node
		cur_node = cur_node.next
	end1, end2 = h2, h1
	
	// assign value to new_head
	new_head = NIL
	if h1.value < h2.value
		new_head = h1
		h1 = h1.next
	else
		new_head = h2
		h2 = h2.next
	
	// merge
	cur_node = new_head
	while True
		if h2 == end2
			// swap h1,h2 and end1,end2 for cleaner code
			h1, h2 = h2, h1
			end1, end2 = end2, end1
		if h1 == end1
			cur_node.next = h2
			while h2.next != end2 // go to the tail node
				h2 = h2.next
			h2.next = new_head
			break
		else
			if h1.value < h2.value
				cur_node.next = h1
				h1 = h1.next
			else
				cur_node.next = h2
				h2 = h2.next
			cur_node = cur_node.next
```

#### Time Complexity & Extra-space Complexity

Time complexity of each step in workflow are: 1. $O(n)$  2. $O(1)$  3. $O(1)$  4. $O(n)$  5. $O(n)$, therefore the total time complexity is $O(n)$

All extra variables used have constant space despite $n$, therefore the total extra-space complexity is $O(1)$.
