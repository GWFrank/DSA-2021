# Problem 2

## 1.

```pseudocode
function FindPrev(T, t_k)
	 node = T.root
	 prev_node = NIL
	 while node != NIL
	 	if node.key >= t_k
	 		node = node.left
	 	else
	 		prev_node = node
	 		node = node.right
	 return prev_node
```

## 2.

If the key larger or equal to $t_k$, $t_{k-1}$ must be in the left subtree, therefore we go left.

If the key is smaller than $t_k$, there are two possibilities:

1. It's $t_{k-1}$
2. It is smaller than $t_{k-1}$

For case 1, because we go to the right subtree, every key is larger than $t_{k-1}$ and larger or equal to $t_k$. `prev_node = node` won't be executed anymore and the algorithm works.

For case 2, $t_{k-1}$ must be in the right subtree, therefore we go right.

If it receives $t_1$ as input, we always go left and `prev_node = node` won't be executed. The return value would be `NIL`.

## 4.

Because `preorder[1]` is the root of the tree, by locating it in `inorder` we can extract (`inorder`, `preorder`) pair of left subtree and right subtree. Therefore if two trees have the same (`inorder`, `preorder`) pair, the root must be the same,  two left subtrees have the same  (`inorder`, `preorder`) pair, and two right subtrees also have the same  (`inorder`, `preorder`) pair.

Doing this recursively for subtrees can show that this two trees must be the same.

## 5.

```pseudocode
/* A.index(v) returns the index of v in array A */
function Reconstruct(inorder, preorder)
	if inorder.len == 0:
		return NIL
	rt = root()
	rt.key = preorder[1]
	l_size = inorder.index(rt.key) - 1
	r_size = inorder.len - l_size - 1
	l_inorder = inorder[:l_size+1]
	l_preorder = preorder[2:l_size+2]
	r_inorder = inorder[l_size+2:]
	r_preorder = preorder[l_size+2:]
	rt.left = Reconstruct(l_inorder, l_preorder)
	rt.right = Reconstruct(r_inorder, r_preorder)
	return rt
```

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
