## Linked List

### Singly Linked List

#### Property

- provides flexibility, which arrays lack
- might requires more resources (computation, memory)
- sequential access

### Doubly Linked List

#### Problem with singly l-list

- removing a node is difficult
- doubly l-list exchange memory for even more flexibility than singly l-list

### Application

#### Sparse Vector

- sparse vector: many element is 0
- use l-list to save some space&time when doing dot operation
- real world example: LIBSVM
