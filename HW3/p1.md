## 1.

Probability of no collision $q$ = (# of arrangements with no collision) / (# of all possible arrangements)
$$
p' = \frac{P^{n^2}_{n}}{(n^2)^n} = \frac{(n^2)!}{n^{2n} \cdot (n^2-n)!}
$$
Then , the probability of any collision $p$ :
$$
p = 1-p' = 1 - \frac{(n^2)!}{n^{2n} \cdot (n^2-n)!}
$$

>Using $P$ instead of $|P|$ for convenience

Let $\epsilon$ = expected # of queries needed and $F(n)$ = # of collisions after $n$ queries.
Then $\epsilon$ should satisfy:
$$
\epsilon - E(F(\epsilon)) = \frac{P}{4}
$$

To calculate $E(F)$, we need $E(G)$, where $G(n)$ = # of empty slots after $n$ queries. By empty slot I mean a hashed value that hasn't occurred yet.
The probability of a slot being empty after $n$ queries is $(1-\frac{1}{P})^n$, and since we are using a uniform hash, we have:
$$
E(G) = P \cdot (1-\frac{1}{P})^n
$$
And # of queries without collision $=$ # of not-empty slot $= P-E(G)$.
Then # of collisions $= n - (P-E(G))$
$$
\begin{split}
E(F) & = n - P + E(G) \\
& = n - P + P(1-\frac{1}{P})^n \\
& = n - P(1-(1-\frac{1}{P})^n)
\end{split}
$$
Plugin this back to the equation:
$$
\begin{split}
\epsilon - (\epsilon - P(1-(1-\frac{1}{P})^\epsilon)) & = \frac{P}{4} \\
P(1-(1-\frac{1}{P})^\epsilon) & = \frac{P}{4} \\
(1-\frac{1}{P})^\epsilon & = \frac{3}{4} \\
\epsilon &= \frac{\ln{\frac{3}{4}}}{\ln{(1-\frac{1}{P})}}
\end{split}
$$
